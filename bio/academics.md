Theodore Lindsey earned his Masters of Science in [Computer Science][ku-eecs] from the [University of Kansas][ku] in December 2016.
He studied data mining with Professor [Jerzy Grzymala-Busse][jerzy].
In May 2014, he earned a Masters degree in [Mathematics][ku-math] from the University of Kansas working with Professor
[Bozenna Pasik-Duncan][bozenna].  His interests are situated at the intersection of programming and mathematics.
In particular, he is interested in data processing and mining and making sense of the data deluge.

Theodore has taught a number of undergraduate courses, including several levels of algebra and calculus.
He also has extensive tutoring experience and has tutored mathematics professionally since before beginning his undergraduate studies.
