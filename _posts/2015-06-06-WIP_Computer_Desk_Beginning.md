I’ve been meaning to build myself a computer desk to replace the one I currently use.  The features I need it to have are:

* Shelf for speakers and other electronics (speakers, amp, server, printer, networking gear) – currently speakers are being used as supports for the shelf =(
* Easy mounting of Ergotron flexible monitor arms (for when I upgrade to them from my static triple monitor stand)
* Easy-to-hide cable management (sufficient to be able to run that inside the nooks and crannies of the desk)
* Able to fit through standard doorways (roughly 34 inches)
* High enough that my legs will fit comfortable while maintaining proper posture for computer usage
* Relatively modular so that disassembly isn’t too difficult if I have to break it down in order to move
* Possible to build with the tools I have available.

So far I’ve just been planning it out in a 3D model (partly to practice my CAD skills and partly so that I can tally up how much lumber I’ll need).  Here’s what I have so far:

And with blockouts of the room and electronics:

Once I get this desk built, I’m thinking of adding a smaller desk section to form an ‘L’ shape. I’ll attach it to the right hand side of the desk and that should provide a quite useful work space when I’m doing non-computer tasks but still want to be within arms reach of it (soldering, writing, scratch work, etc).
