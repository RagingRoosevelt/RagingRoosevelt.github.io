I guess I've left this site dormant for quite a while.  I did a tiny styling update back towards the beginning of 2023 and then added the [full page color comparison](/apps/color_compare.html) applet towards the beginning of 2024 &mdash; after a hiatus since essentially 2016 &mdash; but I didn't really have a vision for what I was doing with the site anymore.

I'd started out originally back in 2015 thinking I'd do some soda reviews and some project updates but I haven't kept on top of my project updates and in 2016-ish I stopped drinking soda all that much.

And so far, revitalizing has meant finally getting around to making the layout responsive and making sure I hit on some of the fundamental accessibility steps including making sure there's a proper header hierarchy, adding a "skip to content" link, and adding `aria-label` attributes where appropriate.  I also finally got around to getting tags and categories working in the new [/blog/search/](/blog/search/) page.

So now, keeping regular updates coming in...

At the start of 2024 I started keeping a log of projects as I finish them (one of the pages in my Obsidian vault).  That's essentially what I'd intended to write about here anyhow.  But I have a habit formed now for actually capturing those thoughts.
