Still using QWERTY.  I previously had a pretty different thumb cluster.  I used to have enter, bksp 
on the large 2x left thumb buttons and del and then space on the large 2x right thumb buttons.  I 
also had vol+ and vol- on the small 1x right thumb buttons.  Here’s the new layout.

I found I wasn’t regularly using the del key with the old layout.  I’m hoping that with both bksp 
and del on the same thumb, going back and forth as necessary will be easier.  Re-training my left 
thumb is more painful than learning to use the ErgoDox in the first place was.  I also added the 6 
on the left side because I found I was often reaching there to try to find the 6 key.
