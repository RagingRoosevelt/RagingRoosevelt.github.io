[(part 1)]({% post_url 2015-06-06-WIP_Computer_Desk_Beginning %}). Since I last
worked on the desk, I realized I had to figure out how to attach the horizontal
braces to the legs.  I hadn’t really done much carpentry before so the obvious
choice – lap joints – didn’t occur to me and it too my sister suggesting them
before I realized it was the obvious choice.  Anyhow, here’s how that looks in
CAD:

From measurements I took in CAD, I decided I needed:

* 6 – 2x4s (8′)
* 2 – 4x4s (8′)
* 1 – 1×12 (8′)
* 2 – 3/4″ plywood (4’x8′)
* drywall screws (2″)
* drywall screws (1 5/8″)

I also needed a chisel set but I’m not factoring that into budget.  I ended up
getting 1/2″ plywood because 3/4″ was heavier than I imagined and I was hoping
that the desk wouldn’t be too unpleasant to move.  I also ended up getting pt
4x4s since the untreated cedar ones were too expensive for what I wanted ($17
for 8′ sections).  All told, it came to $125 including the $20 (cheap) chisel
set I got.

I got right to work putting the desk together.

I hadn’t ever done lap joints before so I was quite proud to have performed my
first one.

I quickly realized that I could jump start the lap joints by pre-cutting them
on the miter saw and then just finishing them with the chisel.

And then, once I got all the lap joints cut, it didn’t take long to get the
ends done and the main table put together.

From here, all I have left to do is

* Cut lumber for the shelf
* Build the shelf
* Put on side of the table – I’m debating this since it’s pretty sturdy as is
  and I like how open it looks
* Sand table
* Oil table
