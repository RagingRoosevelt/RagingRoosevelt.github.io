I've pretty much finished migrating my blog posts from [RagingRoosevelt.com](http://ragingroosevelt.com) 
to here.  I decided to make the move when I realized that I didn't like the level of control over my 
site that I was able to achieve when using wordpress and I was worried about backing up my content 
if I ever decided to leave wordpress, especially if I got more stuff posted.  

I decided not to migrate my soda "reviews" since looking back over them, I don't think they're very 
worthwhile.  I actually started a spreadsheet that I've been using for tracking my favourite sodas, 
which is why I stopped posting reviews.  I would rather just enjoy the soda and make a note of how I 
liked it than try to come up with a number of sentences discussing its merits and shortcomings.  I 
think I might add a page for that spreadsheet at some point.

I also finished migrating all the pages for classes I taught from my math site and my eecs site.  I 
still need to fix formatting issues with a few of them since they're pretty raw (due to a 
combination of throwing them together really quickly and not knowing how to use divs properly at 
that point).  Those pages can be found in the [teaching](/teaching/) section.

I still need to get pagination working on the blog index page.  I think it should be easy but I ran 
into some issues with jekyll that I assume are caused by keeping the blog in a subdirectory rather 
than as the front of the site.  School has been demanding most of my attention lately and I don't 
have enough blog posts to overflow the single index page's capacity yet, so I'll get to that later. 
I also want to add an rss feed but that'll also have to wait.
