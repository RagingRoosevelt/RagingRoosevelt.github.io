<h2>Intro</h2>

Hi!  I like to dabble in a number of maker-related hobbies and I write about them here.  Mostly this ends up in the [blog](/blog/) section.  Notably, I'm into:

- 3D Printing
- Green woodcarving & other woodworking
- Homelabbing
- Sewing



I also have some archive content related to past experiences spent [teaching](/teaching/) and addressing my [academics background](/bio/academics.html).  In these sections, you can find course material from the courses I taught and a catalogue of all of the courses I have taken while pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science and my M.A. in Mathematics.
