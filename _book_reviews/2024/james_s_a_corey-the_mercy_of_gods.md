    A bunch of top-of-their-field humans are kidnapped from Earth to represent
    humanity by a collective of aliens.  Do human's have what it takes to figure
    out what the rules are, and to make the best of a confusing and traumatic
    situation?
review:
- >
    The authors stepped up their game after writing The Expanse series.  I like
    how this story focused down on a much smaller story while at the same time,
    building an even bigger world for the story to take place in.  I felt
    connected to each of the characters and the way that more and more context
    was reveled to the characters naturally paced the story in a way that made
    it enjoyable to read.

    I've read a lot of books where it seems likely that humanity will pull out
    a win in the end.  At no point did it feel like that here and I think that
    really supports what they're going for.  Around every corner there's a new
    problem and throughout, you retain the feeling that humanity is the new tiny
    fish in such a large and uncomprehensible pond.  It's really interesting
    seeing how the different personalities deal with that.
