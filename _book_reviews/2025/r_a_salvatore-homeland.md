summary: Litrpg about a dark elf rebelling against Drow norms.
review: I've never been a massive fan of litrpg so this may color my view, but it felt like the veil covering the rpg mechanics was awfully thin.  The story occasionally felt a little stiff but overall it wasn't too bad. I was worried that it'd feel rather edgy but it didn't come across that way too me.
