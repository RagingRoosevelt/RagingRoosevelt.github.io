summary: >
    As the events of the first book are taking place, a similar uplift is
    taking place on a terraforming team's ship with a population of
    cephalopods.  But how could the uplift virus impact just the one species?
    Can everyone survive an uplifted parasite?
review:
- >
    This book continues the fascinating consideration on how non-humans might
    experience sentience. Both the cephalopods and the parasite's approach felt
    well considered natural. Both felt wholly alien but still relatable. And
    that's the concept that Tch does such a good job playing with here. How can
    these different species reconcile their differences?
- >
    The story eased into the new setting a little slowly but momentum was
    steadily built throughout. Overall the pacing was a little weaker than the
    first book but the payoff was well worth it and I think the small pacing
    issues were easy to ignore on account of an even more fascinating set of
    concepts.
