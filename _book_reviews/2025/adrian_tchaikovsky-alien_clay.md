review: |
    Tchaikovsky does such a good job with first contact Sci Fi. I felt deeply
    connected to Daghdev as he tried to come to terms with the prison and the
    visceral fear all the prisoners lived in from the alien environment. The
    first contact was enjoyably handled and it got very well into the world
    building. I really liked the concept for the way the "other" worked.
