summary: >
    An errant mutation accelerator impacts on a terraformed world. How might a
    sentient species behave if they aren't very much like humans? And how will
    humanity deal with this upstart?
review:
- >
    I haven't come across very many novels that so throughly explore what such
    a different sentient species might be like. How are they similar to humans?
    What issues do they uniquely troubled by? How do they approach problem
    solving?
- >
    I think the thing that really sets this book apart, though, is how well
    the story contrasts the answers to humans.
- >
    On top of the excellent premise and exploration, the story was also
    just fun. Switching between the humans and the others kept it fresh and
    provided good contrast. The conclusion felt a little sudden and magical,
    but I think enough foundation was set up that overall it followed
    adequately. Anyhow I'm eagerly launching into book 2.
