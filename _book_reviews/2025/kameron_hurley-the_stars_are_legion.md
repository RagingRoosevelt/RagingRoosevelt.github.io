    adventure of self discovery.
review: >
    The story felt a bit slow to get going but I think that was just because I
    couldn't understand how stuff fit at first. I'm glad I stuck with it,
    though, because once it hit it's stride, it was quite a fun journey. The
    cast assembling felt fun (if slightly stilted) and I enjoyed seeing how it
    connected once the story came together.
